    I like baking and reading novels My interest towards cake baking has developed during 
    the pandemic period and even helped me earn pocket money by selling cakes as a home Baker.

<h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h3>
<p>
    The book has a well-crafted and thrilling plot, which keeps the reader engaged from start 
    to finish. The events that unfold in this book are some of the most dramatic in the series 
    and have a significant impact on the rest of the story.
